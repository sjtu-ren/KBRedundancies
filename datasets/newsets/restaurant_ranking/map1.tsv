Cracker Barrel made the most surprising deal of 2019 when it took a $140 million stake in growth chain Punch Bowl Social. But that investment was tested in March, when the chain said it would not rescue Punch Bowl from foreclosure amid the coronavirus crisis, choosing instead to focus on helping its flagship chain and newly acquired Maple Street Biscuit Co.	19

It rolled out a separate lunch menu and added some higher-quality dinner options such as steak and salmon, and is also investing in high-tech fryers and a new POS system.	37

As of July, delivery sales at the chain were growing at a 20% clip, and the chain reported that takeout and catering sales were increasing as well.

Chick-fil-A	2ce
While Popeyes got a lot of the chicken buzz in 2019, Chick-fil-A had a busy year in its own right. On top of passing Taco Bell and Subway to become the nation's third-largest chain, it introduced dine-in mobile ordering, eliminated antibiotics from its chicken and added its first new permanent menu item in three years: mac and cheese.	2cf
